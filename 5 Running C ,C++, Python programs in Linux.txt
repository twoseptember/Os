Practical No. 5

AIM:Running C/C++/Python programs in Linux

A. Compiling and executing the C program

Method 1: Using CC Compiler

In this method, we will be compiling and executing the C program code using CC Compiler.

Step1: 
Firstly, we need to open the text editor and terminal for writing code and executing it through the terminal.

Step 2: 
In the text editor we need to write any code using a C programming language.

Example
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { printf("Welcome to the world of Linux");
return 0;
}

Step 3: 
Now, we need to save the file with the .c extension. So in this example, we have saved the file as welcome.c.

Step 4: Open the terminal and install GCC by using following command:  

 First type SU then enter login password 
->  type gcc then hit enter it will ask Y or N enter Y.

Now compile and run the C code in the terminal using the below commands.

cd /Desktop    // go to file saved location of file
cc welcome.c
./a.out

Method 2: Using GCC Compiler

We can also compile and execute the script using the GCC compiler. Create new file as shown in previous example. Use following code. Save the file with name add.c

Example Script:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
 {
int a=10,b-20, c;
c=a+b;
printf("addition of=%d\n",c);
return 0;
}

Step 1: 
Navigate to the directory where the file is been saved. Use the below commands.
 cd Desktop/

Step 2:
 Execute the below command in the terminal for compilation and execution.
cc-o add add.c
./add
â€”----------------------------------------------------------

B. Compile and Run C++ Code in Linux

In this method, we will be compiling and executing the C++ program code using G++ Compiler.

Step 1: 
Write the C++ program code in a text file using a text editor simlilarly as previous and save the file with the .cpp extension. (my.cpp)

Example Script:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
cout << "Welcome to World of Linux";
return 0;
}

Step 2: 
Open terminal and use following command to install g++

-> su
-> enter login password 
-> g++
-> press Y
-> again press Y

After successful installation Navigate to the directory where the file is been saved.
cd /Desktop/

Step 3: 
Execute the below command for compilation and execution.
g++ my.cpp
/a.out


C. Compile and Run Python Code in Linux

Step 1:
Open the text editor and type following python code.

print ("Welcome to Python, Linux rules!")
Save the file with name First.py

Step 2: 
Open terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
cd/Desktop/

Now run the file using following command
python3 First.py
